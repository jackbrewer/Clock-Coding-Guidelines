				<p>This document outlines core processes we have in place, to ensure our work is to the highest possible standard. It should also help create a default state for our code, to make it seamless when passing work between members of the production staff.</p>

		<h2>Browser Support</h2>
		<p>Unless client requirements stipulate otherwise, our full list of browser support is currently:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Chrome</li>
			<li>Firefox</li>
			<li>Opera</li>
			<li>Safari</li>
			<li>IE 7+</li>
		</ul>
		<p>IE 6 should be considered, but does not need to function as fully as in the above &mdash; an acceptable level of usability is expected though. Everything we produce should be tested in all browsers available, on Windows, Mac as well as mobile browsers.</p>

		<h2>Text Editor Setup</h2>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-8">
				<p>Choice of application is up to you - we use Git and SVN for the majority of our projects so integration with these is useful. Most members of staff are currently using <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a>.</p>
				<p>We use tabs for indentation, usually set to a double-space width. We also trim all trailing whitespace when saving (with the exception of Jade files). Please ensure these are both set correctly in your editor.</p>
