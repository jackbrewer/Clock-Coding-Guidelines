				<p>This document outlines core processes we have in place, to ensure our work is to the highest possible standard. It should also help create a default state for our code, to make it seamless when passing work between members of the production staff.</p>

		<h2>Browser Support</h2>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-3">
				<p>Unless client requirements stipulate otherwise, our full list of browser support is currently:</p>

		<p>IE 6 should be considered, but does not need to function as fully as in the above &mdash; an acceptable level of usability is expected though. Everything we produce should be tested in all browsers available, on Windows, Mac as well as mobile browsers.</p>

		<h2>Text Editor Setup</h2>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-8">
				<p>Choice of application is up to you - we use Git and SVN for the majority of our projects so integration with these is useful. Most members of staff are currently using <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a>.</p>
				<p>We use tabs for indentation, usually set to a double-space width. We also trim all trailing whitespace when saving (with the exception of Jade files). Please ensure these are both set correctly in your editor.</p>

				<aside class="callout">
					<p>Jackbrewer on GitHub has made some great <a href="https://github.com/jackbrewer/html-plus.tmbundle">HTML</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jackbrewer/css-plus.tmbundle">CSS</a> bundles that speed up dev time in TextMate and Sublime. His <a href="https://github.com/jackbrewer/Sublime-Settings">Sublime settings</a> are also available to aid with setup.</p>

		<h3>Optimisation</h3>
		<p>The time taken for websites to load directly impacts user experience. There are lots of ways to optimise page speed, with the most common being minimising HTTP requests.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>80% of the end-user response time is spent on the front-end. Most of this time is tied up in downloading all the components in the page: images, stylesheets, scripts, Flash, etc. Reducing the number of components in turn reduces the number of HTTP requests required to render the page. This is the key to faster pages.</p>
			<cite>Yahoo Developer Network</cite>
		</blockquote>
		<p>One way to reduce HTTP requests is by being careful not to use too many scripts or stylesheets â€“ we often combine multiple files before they are output to the browser.</p>
		<p>Another way to increase page speed is to optimise images. We should always use image sprites to combine images where possible and all images should be run through a lossless image compressor such as ImageOptim before being deployed.</p>
